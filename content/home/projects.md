title = "Student Debt and Geographic Disadvantage"
subtitle = "Rates of college enrollment and completion rose for young adults from rural backgrounds at the same time that rising college costs and stagnating family incomes increased rates of student loan borrowing. Recently published in Rural Sociology, this project examines disparities in student debt accumulation among a recent national cohort of US college-goers from rural, suburban, and urban backgrounds. The article received the 2019-2020 Olaf Larson Best Graduate Student Paper Award from the Rural Sociological Society and was covered by The Rural Review, The Daily Yonder, and the Consortium for Policy Research in Education’s Research Minutes podcast. You can download a pre-print of the article here."

title = "Precarious Work and Racial-Ethnic Poverty Gaps in Later Life"
subtitle = "Persistent racial-ethnic inequalities in later life are concerning given the social, economic, and physiological vulnerability of older adults. While lack of employment is often cited as a structural source of racial-ethnic inequalities in poverty, surprisingly little is known about the role of employment quality in maintaining racial-ethnic poverty gaps, particularly as it relates to precarious work. Drawing on theories of structural racism and life course cumulative disadvantage, Lora Phillips and I use Health and Retirement Study data to decompose the proportion of the Black-White and Latinx-White poverty gaps that can be attributed to inequalities in the institutional, temporal, and economic dimensions of precarious work. A draft of this in-progress paper is available here."
