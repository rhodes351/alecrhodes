I'm a PhD candidate in sociology at The Ohio State University and research associate at the John Glenn College of Public Affairs. My research focuses on the causes and consequences of rising economic inequality and insecurity for individuals, families, and communities. Much of my work work brings a political economy, demographic, and/or spatial lens to research on inequality, poverty, and mobility. I'm especially interested in how inequalities accumulate over the life course and across different market contexts, as well as the potential for social institutions and social policies to ameliorate them. You can learn more about my current research projects below.

I'm a member of [Debt Lab](https://u.osu.edu/debtlab/), a collaborative research group housed in The Ohio State University's department of sociology that studies credit, debt, inequality, and insecurity.

Prior to arriving at Ohio State, I received BAs in sociology and economics from Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
