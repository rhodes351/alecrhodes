Precarious Work and Racial-Ethnic Poverty Gaps in Later Life

Persistent racial-ethnic inequalities in later life are concerning given the social, economic, and physiological vulnerability of older adults. While lack of employment is often cited as a structural source of racial-ethnic inequalities in poverty, surprisingly little is known about the role of employment quality in maintaining racial-ethnic poverty gaps, particularly as it relates to precarious work. Drawing on theories of structural racism and life course cumulative disadvantage, Lora Phillips and I use Health and Retirement Study data to decompose the proportion of the Black-White and Latinx-White poverty gaps that can be attributed to inequalities in the institutional, temporal, and economic dimensions of precarious work. A draft of this in-progress paper is available here.
