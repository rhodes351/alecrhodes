Alec Rhodes is a graduate student in the sociology Ph.D. program at Ohio State University. His research focuses on social inequality in returns to education; credit, debt, and wealth; and social policy. He is especially interested in using quantitative methods to investigate the causes and consequences of economic inequality on the individual and societal levels. His other projects examine the causal effects of mortgage borrowing on economic wellbeing and health among older adults. 

He is a member of [Debt Lab](https://u.osu.edu/debtlab/), a collaborative research group that studies credit, debt, inequality, and insecurity. His advisor is [Rachel Dwyer](https://sociology.osu.edu/people/dwyer.46). 

Prior to arriving at Ohio State, he received BAs in sociology and economics from Hobart and William Smith Colleges.
